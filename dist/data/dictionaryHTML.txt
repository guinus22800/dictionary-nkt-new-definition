According to the Madhyamika-Prasangika school, there are two types of four noble truths: gross and subtle.

<p id="Generic-image"><strong>Generic image</strong> The appearing object of a conceptual mind. A generic image, or mental image, of an object is like a reflection of that object. Conceptual minds know their object through the appearance of a generic image of that object, not by seeing the object directly. The conceptual mind mistakes the generic image, or mental image, for the object itself. For example, if we think about our mother, an image of our mother appears to our conceptual mind, and it seems to that mind as if our mother herself is appearing. However, the object that principally appears to that mind is the generic image of our mother. This generic image appears to our mind through the mental exclusion of all objects that are not our mother. It is therefore the appearance of a non-non-mother. As such, like all generic images, it is a permanent phenomenon, whereas our mother herself is impermanent.

Gross impermanence is any impermanence that can be seen by an ordinary sense awareness – for example the ageing and death of a sentient being.

<p id="Imprint"><strong>Imprint</strong> There are two types of imprint: imprints of actions and imprints of delusions.

Imprints of delusions are obstructions to omniscience, and are completely abandoned only by Buddhas.</p>

When we find our object and hold it single-pointedly, this is placement meditation. There are different types of object. Some, such as impermanence or emptiness, are objects apprehended by the mind. Others, such as love, compassion, and renunciation, are actual states of mind. We engage in analytical meditation until the specific object that we seek appears clearly to our mind or until the particular state of mind that we wish to generate arises. This object or state of mind is our object of placement meditation.

<p id="Samsara"><strong>Samsara</strong> This can be understood in two ways – as uninterrupted rebirth without freedom or control, or as the aggregates of a being who has taken such a rebirth. Samsara, sometimes known as ‘cyclic existence’, is characterized by suffering and dissatisfaction. There are six realms of samsara. Listed in ascending order according to the type of karma that causes rebirth in them, they are the realms of the hell beings, hungry spirits, animals, human beings, demi-gods, and gods. The first three are lower realms or unhappy migrations, and the second three are higher realms or happy migrations. Although from the point of view of the karma that causes rebirth there, the god realm is the highest realm in samsara, the human realm is said to be the most fortunate realm because it provides the best conditions for attaining liberation and enlightenment. See <a href="http://kadampa.org/books/joyful-path-of-good-fortune">Joyful Path of Good Fortune</a>.</p>
<p id="Sangha"><strong>Sangha</strong> According to the Vinaya tradition, any community of four or more fully ordained monks or nuns.

<p id="Secret-Mantra"><strong>Secret Mantra</strong> Synonymous with Tantra. Secret Mantra teachings are distinguished from Sutra teachings in that they reveal methods for training the mind by bringing the future result, or Buddhahood, into the present path. Secret Mantra is the supreme path to full enlightenment. The term `Mantra’ indicates that it is Buddha’s special instruction for protecting our mind from ordinary appearances and conceptions. Practitioners of Secret Mantra overcome ordinary appearances and conceptions by visualizing their body, environment, enjoyments, and deeds as those of a Buddha. The term `Secret’ indicates that the practices are to be done in private, and that they can be practised only by those who have received a Tantric empowerment.

To accomplish Tantric realizations, we need to recognize that Deities and their seed-letters are the same nature.</p>
<p id="Seed of delusion"><strong>Seed of delusion</strong> The seed of a delusion is the potentiality for that delusion to arise; it is the substantial cause of the delusion. Until we have finally abandoned a delusion, the seed of that delusion will remain within our mind, even when the delusion itself is not manifest. Seeds of delusions can be eradicated only by the wisdom directly realizing emptiness. See <a href="http://kadampa.org/books/understanding-the-mind">Understanding the Mind</a>.</p>

<p id="Wheel-of-Dharma"><strong>Wheel of Dharma</strong> Buddha gave his teachings in three main phases, which are known as ‘the three turnings of the Wheel of Dharma’. During the first Wheel he taught the four noble truths, during the second he taught the Perfection of Wisdom Sutras and revealed the Madhyamika-Prasangika view, and during the third he taught the Chittamatra view. These teachings were given according to the inclinations and dispositions of his disciples. Buddha’s final view is that of the second Wheel. Dharma is compared to the precious wheel, one of the possessions of a legendary chakravatin king. This wheel could transport the king across great distances in a very short time, and it is said that wherever the precious wheel travelled the king reigned. In a similar way, when Buddha revealed the path to enlightenment he was said to have ‘turned the Wheel of Dharma’ because, wherever these teachings are present, deluded minds are brought under control.</p>
